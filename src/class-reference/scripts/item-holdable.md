**Inherits:** [`BaseHoldable`](./base-holdable.md)

## Description

`ItemHoldable` represents a generic item that the player can pick up and place in designated areas. It allows objects to be rotated and positioned based on surface normals and player input (scroll wheel + click).

*This is intended for non-buildable objects but can still be held. Can be useful for things such as tools etc*
