## Serialized Fields

| Field           | Type        | Description                                        |

## Notes

- This is the counterpart of [`HideObjectStep`](./hide-object-step.md), which hides objects by moving them downward.
- The translation is hardcoded and not animated â€” it's purely a positional jump.
- Assumes the object was previously moved down (e.g. hidden offscreen).
